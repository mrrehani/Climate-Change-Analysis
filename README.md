# Climate Change Analysis


## In this project, I explored the change in global temperature over the centuries. After cleaning the data, I created color-coded graphs with a line of best fit to visualize the increase in temperatures over the years. I also examined which areas were the warmest in different time periods, using both bar graphs and heat distribution maps.<br/> The data for this project is from [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)
