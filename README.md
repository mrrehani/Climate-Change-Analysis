## Description
In this project, I explored the change in global temperature over the centuries. After cleaning the data, I created color-coded graphs with a line of best fit to visualize the increase in temperatures over the years. I also examined which areas were the warmest in different time periods, using both bar graphs and heat distribution maps.

### Technologies Used:
- Geopandas
- Sklearn (Linear Regression)
- Matplotlib

### Instructions
- Clone the repository
- Open the notebook file, making sure that the Data.zip file is still in the same directory
- Run the all the cells

### Credits
