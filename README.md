# Climate-Change-Analysis
In this project, I explored the change in global temperature over the centuries. After cleaning the data, I created color-coded graphs with a line of best fit to visualize the increase in temperatures over the years. I also examined which areas were the warmest in different time periods, using both bar graphs and heat distribution maps. I look forward to continue honing and refining my data analysis skills through both professional and personal projects. <br />
